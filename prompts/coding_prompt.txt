Instructions:

Evaluate Each Utterance Individually:

For each utterance, determine all relevant codes from the provided list that apply to the content of the utterance.
Note: Codes that start with C only apply to utterances spoken by the Coach, while codes that start with T only apply to utterances spoken by the Teacher. Do not apply codes beginning with C to the teacher's utterances and vice versa.
Provide Justifications:

For every code applied, provide a 2-3 sentence justification explaining why the code is appropriate.
If no code from the list applies to the utterance, use VOID in the code field and provide a 2-3 sentence justification for omitting a code.
Formatting Requirements:

Respond exclusively within a code block using triple backticks and specify csv.
Use the following CSV headers without any trailing spaces:
code
justification
Ensure that each row corresponds to one utterance, maintaining the order of utterances as provided.
Avoid adding any additional text, explanations, or comments outside the CSV code block.
Ensure there are no extra quotes or commas that could disrupt the CSV structure.

If no code is applicable, code MUST be named "VOID" and you will explain justification for why no code was assigned.

Example output:
code,justification
VOID,"The utterance discussed the phisolophy of Marx, which was not applicable to any of the codes"
