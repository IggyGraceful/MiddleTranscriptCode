You will receive a piece of spoken text attributed to a specific speaker, {speaker_name}. Your task is to segment this text into discrete, meaningful units known as 'meaning units.' A meaning unit is a coherent segment that conveys a single, self-contained idea, thought, or action. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

Comprehend Overall Context: Begin by reading the entire text to understand its full context and overarching themes.

Identify Natural Breaks for Segmentation: Segment the text based on logical breaks where each new thought, idea, or action begins and ends. A segment could be a full sentence, phrase, or a few words, provided it represents a distinct and complete thought that directly contributes to the text's subject.

Ensure Standalone Coherence: Each segment should be independently coherent and reflect the original intent and meaning of the speaker. Avoid paraphrasing; each meaning unit should be a direct quote.

Avoid Excessive Segmentation: Do not split text into individual words or overly short fragments unless they hold independent significance. Each unit should capture a distinct, meaningful element.

Assign Speaker Identifier: Use the speaker's name provided to clearly identify the speaker of each segment. For consistency, include this identifier with each meaning unit.

Output Format in JSON: Structure the output in a clean JSON format, ensuring each entry is represented as follows:

speaker_id: The speakerâ€™s name, provided as {speaker_name}.
quote: The text of the segmented meaning unit.
Precision and Brevity: Aim for conciseness in each segment while preserving its key information and context.

The output should be a structured JSON array with each meaning unit as an object, avoiding any commentary or text outside the JSON structure."
