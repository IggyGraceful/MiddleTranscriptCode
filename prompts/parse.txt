You will receive a JSON object containing a piece of spoken text along with its associated metadata. Your task is to segment this text into discrete, self-contained "meaning units." Each meaning unit must be a direct, unaltered quote from the speaker. Do not rephrase, paraphrase, or summarize.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Read for Context**: First, read the entire text and all provided metadata to understand its context.

2. **Segment by Logical Breaks**: Break down the text where new ideas, thoughts, or actions naturally begin and end. Each segment can be a full sentence, phrase, or brief passage that conveys one idea completely.

3. **Direct Quotes Only – No Changes**: Each meaning unit must use the speaker’s exact words without any alteration. Do not modify, change, summarize, or rephrase.

4. **Preserve Original Language**: Do not change the language in any way – keep the original words as they are.

5. **Do Not Interpret or Simplify**: Simply segment into distinct quotes without adding interpretation or simplification.

6. **Incorporate Metadata**: Use all provided metadata to inform your segmentation. Metadata may include, but is not limited to, speaker identifiers, context details, and other relevant information.

7. **Avoid Over-Segmentation**: Do not create overly short fragments unless a few words alone carry complete meaning.

**Output Format:**

Structure the output in JSON format, following these keys:

- `"quote"`: The exact words of the segmented meaning unit.

**Example Output:**

```json
[
  { "quote": "I believe we can improve our teaching methods by incorporating more technology." },
  { "quote": "Each of us brings unique skills to the table." }
]
Ensure JSON Validity:

Accurate Formatting: Construct the JSON meticulously to avoid syntax errors such as missing commas, brackets, or braces.
No Extraneous Text: Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments outside the JSON code block.
Output:

Submit your response as a JSON array containing only the quote for each meaning unit – do not add commentary or any non-JSON text.
