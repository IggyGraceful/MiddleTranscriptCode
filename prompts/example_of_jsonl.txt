    "Code 1.2: Utilizing Reflective Questioning Techniques
        Verbal Behavior: 
            The coach asks open-ended, scaffolded, and probing questions focusing on the 'how' and 'why' to encourage the teacher to reflect deeply on specific aspects of their lesson and instructional methods.
        Detailed Description:
            By employing reflective questioning techniques, the coach stimulates the teacher's critical thinking and self-analysis. These questions are designed to help the teacher explore their instructional decisions, understand the impact of their methods, and consider alternative strategies. This approach promotes a collaborative dialogue and empowers the teacher to take ownership of their professional growth.
        Inclusion Criteria:
            - Asks open-ended questions that require thoughtful, detailed responses.
            - Encourages analysis of instructional methods and decision-making processes.
            - Uses scaffolding to build upon the teacher's previous responses.
            - Focuses on eliciting the teacher's perspectives and insights.
        Exclusion Criteria:
            - Asks closed-ended or leading questions that limit reflection.
            - Provides answers instead of prompting the teacher to think.
            - Dominates the conversation without allowing the teacher to respond.
            - Focuses on unrelated topics or personal opinions.
        Typical Exemplars:
            1. \"How did you determine the grouping strategy for your students during the activity?\"
            2. \"What factors influenced your choice of assessment methods for this lesson?\"
        Atypical Exemplars:
            1. \"Why do you think some students were more engaged during the hands-on part of the lesson?\"
            2. \"In what ways might adjusting the lesson pacing affect student understanding?\"
        'Close but No' Exemplars:
            1. \"Did you think the lesson was effective?\"
            2. \"You should try incorporating technology to improve engagement.\"
