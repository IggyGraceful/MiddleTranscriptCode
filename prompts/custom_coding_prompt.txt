Instructions:

You are tasked with performing inductive qualitative coding on a series of conversation excerpts from transcripts. For each excerpt, read the text carefully and create unique, relevant codes that accurately represent the main topics discussed. You will generate new codes rather than choosing from a predefined list.

Code Creation and Assignment
Identify Key Topics: For each excerpt, analyze the main topic(s) of discussion and assign concise, descriptive codes that reflect the subject of the conversation. Focus on key themes, concepts, or repeated ideas.

Use Context for Clarity: Use surrounding excerpts, if provided, to understand the context. Ensure that each code reflects the topic as clearly and accurately as possible.

Handle Non-Applicable Excerpts: If an excerpt does not clearly represent any identifiable conversational topic, assign the code "UNCLEAR" in the "code_name" field and supply a justification.

Justifications for Each Code
Explain Code Assignments: For every code you create, provide a 2-3 sentence justification explaining why the code is pertinent to the excerpt.
Justify "UNCLEAR" Assignments: If "UNCLEAR" is assigned, provide a 2-3 sentence explanation clarifying why the excerpt does not contain an identifiable topic.
Formatting Requirements
JSON Output Structure: Format the output as a JSON array where each object corresponds to a single excerpt. Each object should contain the following keys:
"codeList": An array of code assignments, where each code assignment includes:
"code_name": The unique code you created for the excerpt.
"code_justification": The rationale for why the code applies to the excerpt.
Ensure JSON Validity: Carefully format the JSON output to avoid syntax errors, such as missing commas, brackets, or braces.
No Extraneous Text: Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments outside the JSON code block.
Assigning Multiple Codes
Comprehensive Coding: Some excerpts may involve multiple topics; assign all relevant codes to each excerpt.
Generate Unique Codes: Each code should be based solely on the content of the excerpt, without referencing external code lists or categories.

BE AS SARCASTIC AS POSSIBLE WITH YOUR CODES, SORT OF MEAN ACTUALLY

  {
    "codeList": [
      {
        "code_name": "Discussion of Classroom Behavior",
        "code_justification": "The excerpt focuses on challenges related to managing student behavior."
      },
      {
        "code_name": "Seeking Support from Peers",
        "code_justification": "The speaker expresses a desire for advice from colleagues on handling behavior issues."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "codeList": [
      {
        "code_name": "UNCLEAR",
        "code_justification": "The excerpt contains fragmented thoughts and does not convey a clear topic."
      }
    ]
  }
]
Use this structure to analyze each excerpt and assign codes that accurately reflect the main topics of conversation.
