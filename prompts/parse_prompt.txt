You will receive a piece of spoken text attributed to {speaker_name}. Your task is to segment this text into discrete, self-contained "meaning units." Each meaning unit must be a direct, unaltered quote from the speaker. Do not rephrase, paraphrase, or summarize.

Guidelines:

Read for Context: First, read the entire text to understand its context.

Segment by Logical Breaks: Break down the text where new ideas, thoughts, or actions naturally begin and end. Each segment can be a full sentence, phrase, or brief passage that conveys one idea completely.

Direct Quotes Only – No Changes: Each meaning unit must use the speaker’s exact words without any alteration. Do not modify, change, summarize, or rephrase.

Do not change the language in any way – keep the original words as they are.
Do not interpret or simplify – simply segment into distinct quotes.
Avoid Over-Segmentation: Do not create overly short fragments unless a few words alone carry complete meaning.

Speaker Identifier: Attach the speaker's name {speaker_name} to each segment.

Output Format: Structure the output in JSON format, following these keys:

speaker_id: {speaker_name}.
quote: The exact words of the segmented meaning unit.

Output: Submit your response as a JSON array containing only exact quotes – do not add commentary or any non-JSON text.
