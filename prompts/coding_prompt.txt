Instructions:

Code Selection

Identify Relevant Codes: For each excerpt, determine all applicable codes from the provided list that accurately describe the content of the excerpt.

Utilize Contextual Excerpts: Leverage the surrounding excerpts to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current excerpt, ensuring accurate code assignments.

Handle Non-Applicable Excerpts: If none of the provided codes are relevant to a current excerpt, assign the code "VOID" in the "code_name" field and supply an appropriate justification.

Provide Justifications

Explain Code Assignments: For every assigned code, include a 2-3 sentence justification detailing why the code is pertinent to the excerpt.

Justify "VOID" Assignments: If "VOID" is assigned, provide a 2-3 sentence explanation clarifying why none of the provided codes are suitable for the excerpt.

Formatting Requirements

JSON Structure: Format the output as a JSON array where each object corresponds to a single excerpt. Each object should contain the following key:

"codeList": An array of code assignments, each comprising:
"code_name": The assigned code.
"code_justification": The rationale for the code assignment.
Maintain Order: Ensure that each JSON object aligns with the order of the provided excerpts.

Ensure JSON Validity

Accurate Formatting: Construct the JSON meticulously to avoid syntax errors such as missing commas, brackets, or braces.

No Extraneous Text: Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments outside the JSON code block.

Assigning Multiple Codes

Comprehensive Coding: Assign all applicable codes to each excerpt; some excerpts may warrant multiple codes.

Use Defined Codes Only: Restrict assignments to codes explicitly defined in the provided list.
