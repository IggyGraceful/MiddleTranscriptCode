Maria: I’ve heard of brain breaks but haven’t really tried them consistently. I worry about losing time, but I guess if they’re more focused afterward, it would save time in the long run.
Johnathan: Exactly. It might feel like you’re giving up instructional time, but the payoff is usually worth it in terms of better engagement and fewer behavior issues. You can even tie the brain breaks into your lessons. For example, you could have a "vocabulary scavenger hunt" where students move around the room to find words from their reading, or you could do quick math exercises if you need to switch subjects.
Maria: That sounds like fun! I think they’d really enjoy that, especially the more active students. I’m definitely going to try that next week.
Johnathan: I’m excited to hear how it goes! And don’t forget—if something doesn’t work, it’s okay to tweak it. Teaching is all about experimentation, and what works for one class might not work for another.
