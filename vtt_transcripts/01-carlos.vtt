00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Coach: Hi Carlos, thanks for taking the time to meet with me today.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Carlos: Of course! It's always good to connect and see how I can improve.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Coach: Absolutely. To start us off, what's been on your mind lately in terms of your coaching and leadership goals?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Carlos: Honestly, I'm really focused on giving better feedback to teachers after I observe them. I feel like I could be more specific and give them more concrete things to work with. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Coach: I hear you saying that you want your feedback to be more targeted and actionable. Can you elaborate on that?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Carlos: Yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm just giving general comments, like "good classroom management" but I don't always point out exactly what they did well.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Coach:  That makes sense. It's easy to fall into generalizations. What impact do you think it would have if you were more specific with your examples?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Carlos:  I think it would help teachers really understand what they're doing well so they can keep doing it. Plus, it would make my feedback feel more sincere and less like I'm just going through the motions.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Coach: I see. So, specificity not only clarifies your feedback, but also builds trust and shows that you're genuinely invested in their growth. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Coach:  Have you tried any strategies in the past to be more specific with your feedback?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Carlos: Not really. I've mostly relied on my experience and intuition. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Coach: Experience is definitely valuable, and it sounds like you're ready to explore some new tools to enhance your feedback. One strategy that can be helpful is using a structured observation form with specific "look-fors." What are your thoughts on that?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Carlos:  A structured form? I haven't tried that, but I'm definitely interested.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Coach: It can be as simple or detailed as you like, but the key is to identify specific things to look for during the observation that are aligned with the teacher's goals. For example, if a teacher is working on student engagement, you might have sections on the form for student participation, questioning techniques, and active learning.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Carlos: That's a good idea. It would help me be more focused during the observation.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Coach: Exactly. And it gives you concrete evidence to refer to when you're giving feedback. How does this resonate with you?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Carlos: I like it. It seems like it would provide more structure and keep me on track.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Coach: Great! Would you be willing to give it a try for your next observation?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Carlos: Definitely. I'm observing Ms. Johnson's Algebra class on the 17th. I can use it then.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Coach: Perfect. Maybe we can brainstorm some "look-fors" together based on Ms. Johnson's goals?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Carlos: Sure, that would be helpful. I know she's been working on differentiating instruction.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Coach: Okay, so thinking about differentiation, what are some specific things you could look for in Ms. Johnson's classroom?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Carlos:  Well, she's been trying to provide different levels of activities for her students. So, I could look for evidence of tiered assignments or maybe how she groups students for different tasks.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Coach: That's a great start. How about her use of formative assessment? How is she checking for understanding and adjusting her instruction accordingly?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Carlos:  She's been using exit tickets and quick quizzes. I could definitely observe how she uses those and how she responds to the data she collects.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Coach: Excellent. And what about student choice? Is she providing opportunities for students to demonstrate their learning in different ways?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Carlos:  Yes, she's been experimenting with that. I could look for examples of student choice in projects or presentations, maybe even different options for how they complete assignments.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Coach: These are all fantastic "look-fors," Carlos. How about we organize these into a simple observation form that you can use?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Carlos:  Okay, that sounds good. Maybe we could have a section for each of those areas: tiered activities, formative assessment, and student choice.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Coach: Exactly. And under each section, we can list the specific things you'll be observing, like the types of tiered activities, how she uses exit tickets, and the different options for demonstrating learning.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Carlos:  This is really helpful. I can already see how this will make my observation more focused and my feedback more specific.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Coach: Absolutely. And don't forget to leave space for notes and any anecdotal observations you make during the lesson.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Carlos: Good point. I might also want to have a section for general observations about classroom management and student engagement.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Coach: That's a good idea. It's helpful to capture those overall impressions as well.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Carlos: Okay, so for tiered activities, I could list things like: different worksheets with varying levels of difficulty, small group activities with differentiated tasks, and individual projects with choice in complexity.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Coach: Perfect. And for formative assessment, you could include: observing how she uses exit tickets to check for understanding, how she incorporates quick quizzes or checks for understanding during the lesson, and how she adjusts her teaching based on the data she gathers. 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Carlos:  Right. And for student choice, I could look for: options for presenting information, like oral presentations, posters, or written reports, and different ways to complete assignments, such as using technology, writing essays, or creating models.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Coach: Excellent. This is shaping up to be a very comprehensive and useful observation form, Carlos. I think it's important to also include a section for any other observations or anecdotal notes.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Carlos:  That's a good idea. Sometimes there are things that don't necessarily fit into the specific categories, but they're still worth noting.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Coach: Exactly. It could be something about the classroom environment, student interactions, or anything else that catches your attention.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Carlos: Okay, I'll make sure to include a section for that. I'm actually feeling a bit excited to use this form. It's going to make a big difference in how I approach the observation.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Coach: I agree. It's all about being intentional and focused, and this form will definitely help you with that. Now, let's talk a bit about your actual observation techniques.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Carlos:  Sure. I'm always open to suggestions on how to improve my observation skills.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Coach: One thing that's really helpful is to be as unobtrusive as possible. You want to capture what a typical lesson looks like for that teacher, so try to blend into the background.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Carlos: That makes sense. I sometimes feel like my presence can change the dynamics of the classroom.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Coach: Exactly. So, find a discreet spot in the classroom, maybe in the back or to the side, and avoid making eye contact with the students too much. You want to minimize any disruptions.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Carlos: Okay, I'll keep that in mind. I also tend to focus mostly on the teacher, but I should probably pay more attention to the students as well.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Coach: Yes, that's a great point. Observing student behavior and engagement can give you valuable insights into the effectiveness of the lesson.  What are some ways you think you can observe students effectively?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Carlos: I'll make sure to take detailed notes on student reactions, questions, and participation.  Maybe I can focus on a few students at a time to really get a sense of their understanding and engagement.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Coach: That's a good strategy.  Focusing on a few students allows you to observe more closely. You can use shorthand or abbreviations to quickly jot down your observations. You can also use a coding system to mark certain behaviors or interactions.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Carlos: Like using a plus sign for positive participation and a minus sign for disengagement?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Coach: Exactly. Or you could use different symbols to represent different types of questions, like a question mark for factual questions and a light bulb for higher-order thinking questions.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Carlos: That's helpful. I'll experiment with different coding systems to see what works best for me.  It's important for me to be efficient with my note-taking so I can stay focused on the lesson.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Coach:  Absolutely.  Efficient note-taking is key. And don't forget to jot down any specific examples of things you want to mention in your feedback. Those concrete examples are what make feedback truly valuable.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Carlos:  Will do. I find that if I don't write it down right away, I tend to forget the specifics later.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Coach:  That's a common challenge. It's also important to be mindful of your own biases and interpretations as you observe.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Carlos:  What do you mean by that?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Coach:  We all have our own beliefs and experiences that can influence how we perceive things. Try to be as objective as possible in your observations and focus on the facts.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Carlos:  That's a good reminder. I'll try to be aware of my own biases and how they might affect my observations. How can I do that effectively?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Coach:  One way is to constantly ask yourself if your observations are based on what you actually see and hear, or if you're making assumptions or judgments.  

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Carlos:  That's helpful. So, instead of thinking "the students aren't engaged," I should focus on describing what I'm actually seeing, like "several students are off task."

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Coach: Exactly. And if you're ever unsure about something, or if you feel your interpretation might be clouded, it's always best to clarify with the teacher afterwards.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Carlos:  Okay, I'll make sure to do that. I wouldn't want to give feedback based on a misunderstanding.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Coach: That's a very important point. Clear communication is essential for effective coaching.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Carlos:  I'm starting to feel much more prepared for this observation. I appreciate you taking the time to go over all of this with me.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Coach: That's great to hear, Carlos. I'm confident you'll do a great job. Do you have any other questions about observation techniques?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Carlos:  No, I think you've covered everything really well. I appreciate the guidance.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Coach: You're very welcome. Now, let's move on to discussing how you deliver the feedback itself. How do you typically structure your feedback conversations?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Carlos: Usually, I start by giving my overall impression of the lesson, then I point out some things they did well, and finally, I mention a few areas for growth.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Coach: That's a solid foundation. It's important to provide a balanced perspective. Have you ever heard of the "sandwich method" for delivering feedback?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Carlos: The sandwich method? No, what's that?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Coach: It's a technique where you start with positive feedback, then offer constructive criticism, and end with another positive point. It helps create a more supportive environment for receiving feedback.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Carlos: That makes sense. I sometimes feel like teachers get a little defensive when I suggest areas for improvement.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Coach: The sandwich method can definitely help with that. It's about framing the feedback in a way that feels encouraging and supportive. Would you be open to trying this approach with Ms. Johnson?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Carlos: Yeah, I think that would be helpful.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Coach: Okay, so let's imagine you've just observed Ms. Johnson's class using the observation form we created. What's something positive you noticed related to differentiation?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Carlos: I noticed she had different learning stations set up, and each station had activities geared towards different learning styles and levels. It was really effective in keeping students engaged.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Coach: That's a great observation. Now, how could you phrase that as positive feedback using the sandwich method? Remember to be specific.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Carlos: I could say something like, "Ms. Johnson, I was really impressed with how you implemented learning stations in your lesson today. Having different activities at each station, like the hands-on activity at station one and the problem-solving challenge at station three, really catered to the diverse needs of your learners."

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Coach: Excellent! That's specific and encouraging. Now, let's think about a constructive piece of feedback. Did you notice anything that could be tweaked or improved?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Carlos: I noticed that during the station rotations, a few students seemed a bit unsure of what to do at the technology station. They spent some time getting started, which slowed down their progress.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Coach: Okay, how could you frame that constructively, keeping in mind the sandwich method?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Carlos: Maybe I could say, "While the stations were very engaging overall, I noticed a few students at the technology station had some initial confusion about the task. Perhaps providing a more detailed task card or a quick demonstration at the beginning could help them get started more efficiently."

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Coach: That's a great suggestion, Carlos. You're offering a specific solution while still being supportive. Now, to complete the "sandwich," what's another positive point you could end with?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Carlos: I could mention how well Ms. Johnson circulated during the station rotations. She provided individual support and encouragement to each student, which really fostered a positive learning environment.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Coach: That's a perfect way to end on a positive note. You've effectively used the sandwich method to deliver balanced and actionable feedback. How does it feel to practice delivering feedback this way?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Carlos: It feels good. I think having the observation form and the sandwich method in mind really helps me structure my thoughts and deliver the feedback more effectively.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Coach: I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's try another scenario. Let's say you observed Ms. Johnson using exit tickets as a formative assessment. What did you notice?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Carlos: I noticed that she collected the exit tickets but didn't really have time to review them before the end of class.  

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Coach: Okay, and how do you think that impacted her ability to adjust her instruction?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Carlos: Well, she wasn't able to address any misconceptions or provide immediate feedback to students, so they might have left class with some lingering confusion.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Coach: That's a good point. How could you frame this as constructive feedback using the sandwich method?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Carlos:  I could start by saying, "Ms. Johnson, I really liked how you used exit tickets to check for student understanding at the end of the lesson.  It's a great way to gather quick data on student learning. However, I noticed that you didn't have time to review the tickets before the end of class.  Perhaps allocating a few minutes at the beginning of the next class to address any common misconceptions or provide feedback could enhance the effectiveness of this strategy."

00:20:46.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Coach:  Excellent! That's a very specific and helpful suggestion. And to finish the sandwich?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Carlos: I could add, "I also appreciated how you clearly explained the purpose of the exit ticket to the students and encouraged them to be honest in their responses."

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Coach: Perfect. You're demonstrating a good grasp of the sandwich method and how to provide constructive feedback.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Coach: I'm glad to hear that, Carlos. It sounds like you're well on your way to providing more effective feedback to your teachers.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Carlos: I think so too. I'm actually looking forward to my next observation now.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Coach: That's fantastic! Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today, or any other areas where you feel you need support?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Carlos:  Hmm, I think I'm good for now.  I feel much more confident about my upcoming observation, and I have some concrete tools to use.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Coach: That's great to hear.  Remember, the key is to be specific, focus on the teacher's goals, and frame your feedback in a supportive way.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Carlos: I will.  And I also want to make sure I'm being a good active listener during the feedback conversation.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Coach: That's an excellent point, Carlos. Active listening is crucial for effective communication and building rapport.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Carlos: Do you have any tips for active listening during a feedback conversation?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Coach: Of course.  First, make sure you're truly present and focused on the teacher. Put aside any distractions and give them your full attention.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Carlos:  That's important. I sometimes catch myself thinking about other things while someone is talking.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Coach: It happens to everyone.  Just try to be mindful of it and bring your focus back to the conversation.  Also, use nonverbal cues to show you're engaged, like nodding, making eye contact, and leaning in.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Carlos:  Okay, I can do that.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Coach:  And make sure you're really listening to understand, not just waiting for your turn to speak.  Reflect back what you hear them saying to ensure you understand their perspective.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Carlos:  So, I could say something like, "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated because..." or "I'm hearing that you're concerned about..."

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Coach: Exactly.  That shows that you're truly listening and trying to understand their point of view.  And ask clarifying questions to make sure you're on the same page.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Carlos:  This is helpful.  I think I sometimes jump to conclusions without fully understanding the teacher's perspective.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Coach:  Active listening can help prevent that.  It allows you to build a stronger connection with the teacher and create a more collaborative environment.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Carlos:  I'll definitely focus on being a better active listener during my feedback conversations.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Coach:  That's great, Carlos.  Do you have any other questions or concerns about the feedback process?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Carlos:  No, I think I'm all set.  I feel much more prepared and confident now.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Coach:  Wonderful.  I'm confident you'll do a great job with your upcoming observation.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Carlos:  Thanks for all your help and support.  I really appreciate it.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Coach:  You're very welcome, Carlos.  I'm always here to support you in any way I can.  Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need anything.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Carlos:  I will.  Thanks again for your time.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Coach:  You're welcome, Carlos.  Have a great week!
