Instructions:

Determine Relevant Codes:

Identify all relevant codes from the provided list that apply to the content of the excerpt.
Provide Justifications:

For every code applied, provide a 2-3 sentence justification explaining why the code is appropriate.
If no code from the list applies to the excerpt, still create a code but name it VOID in the code field and provide a 2-3 sentence justification for omitting a code.
Formatting Requirements:

Respond exclusively within a code block using triple backticks and specify json.
Structure the output as a JSON array of objects, where each object represents a excerpt with the following keys:
code: The name of the applied code.
justification: The explanation for why the code was assigned.
Ensure that each object corresponds to one excerpt, maintaining the order of excerpts as provided.
Avoid adding any additional text, explanations, or comments outside the JSON code block.
Ensure that the JSON is properly formatted without syntax errors, such as missing commas or unmatched braces.
Handling VOID Codes:

If no code is applicable, the code MUST be named VOID and you MUST explain the justification for why no code was assigned.

Assign every code that is applicable. This means some excerpts will be assigned multiple codes.
