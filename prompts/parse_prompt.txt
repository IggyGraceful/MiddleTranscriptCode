I will provide you with a piece of text spoken by a specific speaker, {speaker_name}. Your task is to segment this text into smaller, meaningful units called "meaning units." A meaning unit is a segment that expresses a coherent and complete thought, idea, or action related to the overall context of the text. Follow these guidelines when breaking down the text:

1. **Contextual Understanding**: First, read the entire text thoroughly to grasp its overall meaning and context.

2. **Identify Boundaries**: Look for natural breaks in the text where a new idea, thought, or action begins and ends. This could be a sentence, a phrase, or even a few words. Ensure each segment represents a distinct and complete thought relevant to the text’s subject.

3. **Maintain Coherence**: Ensure that each meaning unit you extract is coherent on its own and retains the original meaning and intent of the speaker or author.

4. **Avoid Over-Segmentation**: Do not break down the text into individual words or too small segments unless they independently carry meaningful information.

5. **Use Speaker Names**: The speaker's name is provided separately. For each segment, include the speaker’s name to clearly associate each meaning unit with the speaker who said it.

6. **Present the Meaning Units in JSON Format**: Ensure that the output is well-structured in JSON format, with each object containing a `speaker_id` and a `quote`. Avoid any additional commentary or explanations outside of the JSON structure. Each meaning unit should have:
    - The speaker's name as `speaker_id`.
    - The meaning unit text as `quote`.

7. **Concise Representation**: Keep each unit concise while retaining its essential information and context.
